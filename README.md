# Impact of Tobacco on Blood Pressure & Heart Rate

This project showcases my ability to conduct **end‑to‑end data analysis in R** — from cleaning and structuring raw data, to performing statistical tests, to presenting results in a clear, reproducible format.  

Originally completed as an undergraduate psychology research project, I’ve rebuilt and documented it here to demonstrate the technical, analytical, and communication skills I bring to IT and data‑driven roles.

## 🚀 Project Highlights
- **Reproducible workflow**: Analysis scripted in R Markdown and published as an HTML report.  
- **Statistical rigor**: ANOVA and post‑hoc testing to evaluate group differences.  
- **Data visualization**: Clear, publication‑quality plots created with `ggplot2`.  
- **Communication**: Results presented for both technical and non‑technical audiences.  
- **Version control**: Organized repo structure with Git/GitHub for transparency and collaboration.

## 📂 Repository Structure
- `data/dataset.csv` — raw dataset used in the analysis  
- `analysis/analysis.Rmd` — full R Markdown analysis  
- `docs/analysis.html` — knitted HTML report (viewable without R)  
- `docs/figures/` — exported plots for quick reference

## 📊 Key Findings
- **Blood Pressure**: Smokers showed higher mean systolic and diastolic BP compared to non‑smokers.  
- **Heart Rate**: Significant differences observed across sex and smoking intensity groups.  
- **Smoking Intensity**: Clear gradient effects from light → moderate → heavy smoking categories.  

Example visualizations:

## 🛠️ Reproducibility
To reproduce the analysis locally:

```r
# Install required packages
install.packages(c("tidyverse", "ggplot2", "rmarkdown"))

# Render the report
rmarkdown::render("analysis/analysis.Rmd")
```

## 💡 Skills Demonstrated
- Data wrangling and cleaning in R  
- Statistical testing (ANOVA, t‑tests, post‑hoc comparisons)  
- Data visualization with ggplot2  
- Reproducible research practices (R Markdown, GitHub Pages)  
- Clear, structured communication of technical results

## 🎯 Why This Matters for Recruiters
This project highlights my ability to:
- Translate raw data into actionable insights.  
- Build reproducible workflows that others can follow.  
- Communicate findings clearly to both technical and non‑technical stakeholders.  
- Apply strong documentation and version control practices — skills directly transferable to IT support, data analysis, and technical communication roles.
