      <h2>Introduction</h2>
      <p>
        Cardiovascular diseases (CVD) are the leading cause of preventable mortality worldwide. 
        Hypertension and tobacco consumption are two of the most significant risk factors. 
        This project investigates the relationship between cigarette smoking and cardiovascular 
        measures — specifically systolic blood pressure (SBP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), 
        and heart rate (HR) — using data from the Framingham Heart Study.

      <h2>Methods</h2>
      <p>
        A subset of 780 self-identified smokers aged 44–80 years was analyzed. Participants were 
        categorized into three groups: Light (≤5 cigarettes/day), Moderate (6–20/day), and Heavy (≥21/day). 
        One-way ANOVAs and t-tests were conducted to examine differences in SBP, DBP, and HR across groups 
        and by sex. Visualizations were generated in R with <code>ggplot2</code>.
      </p>

      <h2>Results</h2>
      <p>
        Heavy smokers exhibited significantly higher SBP compared to moderate smokers. DBP differences 
        approached significance, while HR showed no overall group differences. Stratified analyses revealed 
        that female heavy smokers had higher SBP than female moderates, and moderate-smoking women had 
        slightly higher HR than men in the same group.

      <h2>Discussion</h2>
      <p>
        The findings suggest that heavy smoking is associated with elevated blood pressure, reinforcing 
        smoking as a cardiovascular risk factor. However, the absence of differences between light and 
        heavy smokers indicates that other variables (e.g., age, BMI, family history) may confound outcomes. 
        Gender-specific effects were observed, highlighting the need for further research.
